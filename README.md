# H4ckScr1pts

Some scripts I created to exploit various vulnerabilities in machines and challenges on the Hack the Box platform.

## Specifics

Each script has comments on what needs to be modified in order for it to work.

## Proxy

As I developed them when I was at university, the network does not allow certain types of traffic, if you are in the same situation, just use a proxy like burp and redirect the traffic to another network, (tor for example) that way they will work.

## Final?

I know they're not the most elegant scripts in the world but they work ^_^
